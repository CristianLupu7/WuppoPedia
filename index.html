    <h1>Wuppo</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>Lore of Wuppo is known for its complexities and details.</h2>
    <p>The whole Chronology of Wuppo is divided between three main generations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First Generation</li>
        <li>Second Generation</li>
        <li>Third Generation</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- FIRST GENERATION -->
    <h2>First Generation</h2>
    <div class="text-image">
        <p>
            The earliest known point of Wuppo world is the presumed First Generations. It was, in fact, far from the first generation created by Krenktorium, but because of the nature of Krenktorium-created worlds the only creature that lived there was Redav Kned, which passed on his knowledge to the protagonist of the game.

    <!-- SECOND GENERATION -->
    <h2>Second Generation</h2>
    <div class="text-image">
        <p>
            After the "death" of Redav Kned, Krenktorium created the second generation. The second generation was the generation in which the Bankkrent and Blieken came to life. The Blieken were a cube shaped species, which consisted of only one of bliek that had three legs and one claw-like arm. But Redav Kned managed to multiply that bliek, which led to the creation of the whole species that made Blenk Tower for shielding the planet from Blendbjick planet, Redav Kned's Guesthouse which was used to create more blieken and the Bliekbal game. The closest thing the Blieken had to a leader was Protomus Blenk - a blieken astronomist who apparently met the Blendbjick in his dreams and studied the Blendbjick planet. Protomus then saw the danger of the Blendbjick planet falling on the world, which led blieken to creation of the Blenk Tower. The Blieken though were destroyed not by the fall of the planet, but after feeding the Bankkrent too much mud he threw up. After the Blieken died the Bankkrent began to grow hungry, and the more he was hungry the more he cried, which led to the creation of the Sinkhole.

    <h2>Third Generation</h2>
    <h3>Fnakker Wars</h3>
    <div class="text-image">
        <p>
            After the extinction of the Blieken race Krenktorium 'broke' because of the amount of Plump that flew into its realm. This overflow led to the Third Generation, which consisted of four new main races that inherited the main qualities of Blieken: Wums (intellect and the creationist talent), Blussers (peace of mind), Splenkhakkers (practicality), and Fnakkers (arms and creationist talent). These new races stayed in the world of Wuppo until the Fnakkers started to attack the other races. The wishes of Fnakkers to rule the world led to the Fnakker Wars, the only known war in Wuppo. This war lasted for a long time until a wum named Bert Smulder united the Wums, Blussers, and Splenkhakkers against the Fnakkers by combining Splenk with the Bluswater. This combination led to the hypergrowth of Splenk, the effect of which was used to fight fnakkers. After this discovery Fnakkers started to lose and were pressured into the Sinkhole. After the Fnakkers fell they were presumed dead.

    <h3>Fnakker Wars Aftermath</h3>
     <p>
        After the victory in war the races started buliding their own homes, which led ot the creation of the Wumhouse, Wumgarden, and Wondersplenk. The Wumhouse was created for the Wums to have a safe place to live and enjoy life. The Wumgarden was made for the Blussers to live in peace and for them to take care of the plants living there. Finally, Wondersplenk was an ambitionist project of the Splenkhakkers. Long after the Wumhouse was created some Wums became bored with constant relaxing and the Popo Movement was created. Popos saw that both the left and the right of Wumhouse were occupied and became drilling the ground. They discovered a cave in which a City was built. Popos connected the city to the surface using the Popo Train. This city was made for wums to work in, and the new economic system of CREDIT was created. CREDIT is a reward for working - each citizen gains CREDIT for the work and this counts to the City's whole amount, once a certain number of CREDIT is reached a new expansions to the city is made. After the first expansion the City became an Old Town, the bridge with 2 Trams was build and the main are of Popo City transfered to the right. At the moment of the game, there exist 4 areas in Popo City, which are Old Town, Central, Undercity, and DrillHall. DrillHall was made for expansion after reaching 100,000 CREDIT and is the only expansion Scallywag sees happen. This expansion was presumed to lead to the creation of the New Popylon.
